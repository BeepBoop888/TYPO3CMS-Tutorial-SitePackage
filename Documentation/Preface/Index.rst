Site Package Benefits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The development of a website can be approached in several ways. Standard websites usually consist of HTML documents, which contain texts and have image files, video files, styles, etc. referenced. The enterprise content management system TYPO3 features a clean separation between design, content and functionality of a website and allows developers/integrators to add simple as well as sophisticated functions to the system easily.

Using extensions are a powerful way to get the most out of TYPO3. Extensions can be installed, deinstalled, replaced, etc. and extend the core system with functions and features not shipped with the core system. An extension typically consists of PHP files, but can also (or only) contain design templates (HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, etc.) and global configuration.

The visual appearance of a website does not require any PHP code and therefore the site package extension described in this tutorial consists of design template and some basic site configuration files only. This means, the reader does not require any programming knowledge as such.

By building the site package as an extension, all relevant files are stored at a central point and changes can easily be tracked in a version control system such as Git. Despite the fact that TYPO3 supports several methods of implementing websites, this approach is a very flexible and professional way. At the same time, the process is not overly complicated.
