Summary
-------

First and foremost: **congratulations!** You reached a point where you successfully implemented a custom Site Package for TYPO3. In fact, you have not only developed a "theme" for your website, you also built a fully working extension for TYPO3, which can be installed, uninstalled, copied to another TYPO3 instance and put under version control. You could also share your Site Package with others by uploading your extension to the `TYPO3 Extension Repository <https://extensions.typo3.org>`_.
